# **Predict Medical Costs with Regression**

The following notebook is the final project of the 'Machine Learning' course. It consists of applying two regression methods to a dataset to find the best model, in this case, linear regression and polynomial regression. 

This project uses the insurance dataset provided by [Miri Choi](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance/data) on Kaggle, and the objective is to predict insurance expenses (medical cost).
