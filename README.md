# **Final Machine Learning Project**

This project consists of applying regression and classification techniques to datasets to find the best models.

For regression, an insurance dataset provided byr [Miri Choi](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance/data) on Kaggle was used, employing Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression methods to predict insurance expenses (medical costs).

For classification, a classifier for second and third degree burn images was developed using Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks.
